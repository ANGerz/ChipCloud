ChipCloud 3 is a fresh rewrite of the original quickly hacked together library. The previous iteration was becoming popular as an easy replacement for a dropdown/spinner in e-commerce user interfaces, offering improved UX and more efficient use of screen real estate. The rewrite provides an improved API, a fraction of the code, and has no dependencies on other libraries. The biggest change is it's now not a View/Layout; it's a simple class that adds Chips to a supplied ViewGroup.

## Usage

Although ChipCloud can be used with any ViewGroup to get the wrapping 'Chip Cloud' that was the original focus of the library you should use [Google's FlexboxLayout](https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout) - see the demo project for a full example.

```java
//To create the same wrapping cloud as previous incarnation use Google's FlexboxLayout:
FlexboxLayout flexbox = (FlexboxLayout) findViewById(R.id.flexbox);

//Create a new ChipCloud with a Context and ViewGroup:
ChipCloud chipCloud = new ChipCloud(this, flexbox);

//Add a single Chip:
chipCloud.addChip("HelloWorld!");

//or pass a List or Array of any Object:
String[] demoArray = getResources().getStringArray(R.array.demo_array);
chipCloud.addChips(demoArray);
```

## Modes

### Multi  
```ChipCloud chipCloud = new ChipCloud(this, flexbox, ChipCloud.SelectMode.multi);```

The default mode; multiple chips can be selected.

### Single
```ChipCloud chipCloud = new ChipCloud(this, flexbox, ChipCloud.SelectMode.single);```

Only one chip can be selected at a time.

### Mandatory
```ChipCloud chipCloud = new ChipCloud(this, flexbox, ChipCloud.SelectMode.mandatory);```

Similar to a RadioGroup, only one chip can be selected, and once one has been chosen it's not possible to deselect it, you can click on another chip but one will always be checked.

### None
```ChipCloud chipCloud = new ChipCloud(this, flexbox, ChipCloud.SelectMode.none);```

No interaction, the chips just act as feedback for a user (eg. to display a list of tags associated with a news article).
